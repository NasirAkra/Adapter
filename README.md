# Android Adapter Example

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Adapters** in Android to bind data to UI components such as `RecyclerView`. The Adapter connects your data with the views, allowing you to display lists of items in an optimized way. In this example, we will create a custom adapter for a `RecyclerView` and demonstrate how to use it in an Android activity.

## Features

- Custom Adapter implementation for `RecyclerView`.
- Implements the ViewHolder pattern to improve performance.
- Supports item click interactions with a listener interface.
- Simple example using `TextView` items in the list.

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Android SDK 29 or higher
- Minimum SDK: 21 (Lollipop)

### Explanation:
1. **Overview**: Brief description of what the Adapter does in the app.
2. **Setup Instructions**: Steps on how to clone the repo, add dependencies, and use the adapter in an Android project.
3. **Adapter Class**: The code for the custom adapter.
4. **Activity Setup**: How to use the adapter in an activity with `RecyclerView`.
5. **Layouts**: Example layouts for `item_layout.xml` (individual list item) and `activity_main.xml` (where the RecyclerView is used).
6. **Contributing**: How others can contribute to the project.
7. **License**: Include a license section if you're sharing the code publicly.

You can further modify this template based on the specific adapter type you're working with (e.g., for `GridView`, `ListView`, etc.).
